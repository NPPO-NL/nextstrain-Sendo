# Tracking *Synchytrium endobioticum*, the Potato Wart Disease pathogen

### Background
*Synchytrium endobioticum* (Schilb.) Perc. is a chytrid fungus (Chytridiomycota) causing potato wart disease, which is one of the most important quarantine diseases on cultivated potato. Host tissues infected with this fungus develop tumor-like galls (i.e. warts) rendering the crop unmarketable. The malformed tissue produces resting spores which are released into the surrounding soil when the host tissue decays, and once released, spores can remain viable and infectious for decades. Individual isolates can be further characterized as pathotypes based on their virulence on a differential set of potato cultivars. 

Reported from many countries worldwide, *S. endobioticum* is believed to originate from potato-growing areas in the Andean region from where it was taken into the United Kingdom in the aftermath of the Irish potato famine (~1880s). Initially, the disease spread quickly and widely in Europe, but phytosanitary measures restricted its movement to other parts of the world. Today, quarantine measures have been implemented through phytosanitary legislation world-wide. In addition, *S. endobioticum* is on the federal select agent program of the United States of America. Restricting potato cultivation in infested fields and the use of resistant potato cultivars are the only known efficient control strategies.

### Tracking the pathogen using mitogenomic sequences
Mitogenomic variation can be used to track and trace the spread of the potato wart pathogen. The *S. endobioticum* mitochondrial genome is a 72.9 Kbp linear molecule encoding 14 protein coding genes typically found on fungal mitogenomes, two rDNAs and a reduced set of five tRNAs. The linear molecule is characterized by terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) which was validated by tailing and PCR amplifying the telomeric ends.  Both the *cox1* and *cob* genes harbor introns containing homing endonuclease genes. Interestingly a gene coding for DNA polymerase type B (*dpoB*), which are also found in linear mitochondrial plasmids, was identified on the *S. endobioticum* mitogenome (Van de Vossenberg *et al.*,  [2018](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-018-1246-6)). Five structural mitogenomic variants were identified based on presence-absence differences of intronic sequences in *cox1* and *cob*, and absence of the *dpoB* - TIR region (Van de Vossenberg *et al.* 2022, in preparation). As presence-absence differences in intronic sequences introduce noise in the analysis, intronic sequences were removed from the sequences included in this build.

### Nextstrain, a community effort
This Nextstrain build contains complete *S. endobioticum* mitogenome sequences from materials collected at outbreak locations and or taken from (historic) compost collections. Origin of pathogen isolates can be visualized on different geographical levels (i.e continent, country, state, and municipality or town) when this information is available. 

**Please note** that central coordinates (or an approximation thereof) are used for the different geographical levels in this build.  These never refer to specific fields that are currently in use, or have been used in the past, for potato cultivation. Also, this build contains materials from locations that have historically been found to be infested. It is possible that the pathogen is no longer present at those locations. For country-level pest status please refer to the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization distribution map for *Synchytrium endobioticum* [(EPPO global database)](https://gd.eppo.int/taxon/SYNCEN/distribution). 

Sharing data with this interactive online tool will enable the plant mycology field to better understand and communicate the diversity and spread of this important fungal pathogen. Organizations are invited to share data or materials for inclusion in the build. Updates will be communicated via Resource Announcements to which contributing organizations are invited as co-author.


### Contribute to the build
The reliability of a track and trace tool depends on sampling and metadata completeness. You can contribute to the build by providing infected plant materials, resting spore suspensions, extracted DNA, Illumina sequence datasets or assembled mitogenomes together with relevant metadata to the Netherlands Institute for Vectors, Invasive Plants and Plant Health (NIVIP), which is part of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Safety Authority [(NVWA)](https://english.nvwa.nl). On the NVWA website, a generic [form](https://formdesk.minlnv.nl/kcdv/nvwa-vragen-eng-v1/?def_standaard=1&get=1&sidn=f250522339034dbe9ec8a2b134ee170e) is available to get in touch in case you would like to contribute to the build.


### Versions
[**1 August 2022**](https://nextstrain.nrcnvwa.nl/Sendo/20220801) Shows 172 mitogenomes sampled between 1986 and 2020 representing 16 countries. Information on pathotype identity, haplogroup and (combinations of) mitogenomic structural variants is provided.
